#How to?
These libraries

```r
library(dplyr)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     filter, lag
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

```r
library(rayshader)
```

```
## Warning in rgl.init(initValue, onlyNULL): RGL: unable to open X11 display
```

```
## Warning: 'rgl.init' failed, running with 'rgl.useNULL = TRUE'.
```

```r
library(elevatr)
library(raster)
```

```
## Loading required package: sp
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'raster'
```

```
## The following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':
## 
##     select
```

Getting the boundaries - in this example for Denmark:

```r
denmark <- readRDS(url("https://geodata.ucdavis.edu/gadm/gadm4.0/Rsf/gadm40_DNK_0_sf.rds"))
```

Get the elevation from
Amazon Web Services Terrian Tiles and the Open Topography global datasets API:

```r
dem <- get_elev_raster(denmark, z = 6)
```

```
## Error in loadNamespace(x): there is no package called 'rgdal'
```



```r
denmark_dem <- raster::mask(dem, denmark)
```

```
## Error in h(simpleError(msg, call)): error in evaluating the argument 'x' in selecting a method for function 'mask': object 'dem' not found
```



```r
denmark_mat <- raster_to_matrix(denmark_dem)
```

```
## Error in raster_to_matrix(denmark_dem): object 'denmark_dem' not found
```



```r
denmark_mat %>% 
  sphere_shade(texture= "imhof3") %>% 
   plot_3d(denmark_mat, windowsize = c(1200,1200),
                     zscale = 20, zoom = 0.75, phi = 89, theta = 0, fov = 0, background = "black")
```

```
## Error in plot_3d(., denmark_mat, windowsize = c(1200, 1200), zscale = 20, : object 'denmark_mat' not found
```



```r
render_snapshot(filename = "../fig/denmark2.png", samples = 100, width = 6000, height = 6000)
```

```
## Error in render_snapshot(filename = "../fig/denmark2.png", samples = 100, : No rgl window currently open.
```


```
## Error in knitr::include_graphics("../fig/denmark2.png"): Cannot find the file(s): "../fig/denmark2.png"
```
