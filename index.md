This is not a course.

![Pages under continual construction](fig/under-construction_geek_man_01.png)

In our work assisting students (and sometimes researchers) working with data,
we encounter a special type of challenge. Or problem.

Challenges that are relatively rare. Something where the solution is useful, but probably not
useful for so many people that it makes sense to build an entire course on it.
Or where an entire course on the solution would take 15 minutes.
Or where we only encounter the challenge once a year.

These pages are dedicated to these challenges. 

A bestiarium is a compendium of beasts. From the middle ages they were
illustrated volumes describing various animals. Especially weird and exotic 
animals.
